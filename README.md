# ReactNative Maps Clustering Example

This is a showcase application for [react-native-maps-super-cluster](https://github.com/novalabio/react-native-maps-super-cluster), an high-performing map component with clustering for React Native, powered by [AirBnB's react-native-maps](https://github.com/airbnb/react-native-maps) and [MapBox's SuperCluster](https://github.com/mapbox/supercluster).

You can test the app in your device with the Expo [demo app](https://exp.host/@razor7/novalabreactnativemapsclusteringexample).

## Running

```
npm -i -g exp

git clone https://github.com/novalabio/react-native-maps-super-cluster-example.git clusteredMap

cd clusteredMap

npm i

npm start
```

## TODO

* showcase `fitToElements` and `fitToRegion`
* showcase user-defined actions triggerable by a marker `onPress`
* showcase compatibility with existing `react-native-maps` features
